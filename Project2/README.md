<h3> Project 2 </h3>
<h4> Recapi </h4>
<p>
Recapi is a recipe suggestion app allows users to find recipes to cook based on their current ingredients. Users select their current ingredients sends it to their "Pantry". The application will then build a query to be sent to the Spoonacular API which will return a list of recipies in a JSON format. The application will then display the recipe's picture, ingredients, and instruction. This app will possibly not use all the ingredients inputed and will instead will find recipies that have the most similiar ingredients.

  <h4> Contribution </h4>
  <p>
 I worked primarily in the Angular front-end and database development portions of the project. I was in charge of creating all the API calls to retrieve information from 3rd party sites. I created multiple service methods that use the Spoonacular and Edimam API to retrieve recipes, and instructions. Also worked on developing the front end methods to display information to the user as well as bugfixing/optimization.
